# 💫 About Me

Hey, I’m Akari — welcome!

I’ve been programming for over 5 years. I started taking coding seriously in 2020, when I began developing PocketMine plugins, which led me to learn PHP.
In 2022–2023, I moved on to creating Spigot plugins in Java, and over time I became comfortable with the language as well.

I never really studied programming in a formal way — no books or courses — I just learned by watching YouTube tutorials and experimenting on my own. That’s how I fully learned PHP and most of Java.

Right now, I don’t code as much as I used to — I spend most of my time on my hobbies:
- 🎮 playing with friends
- 💬 chilling on Discord
- 🌆 hanging out
- 🎞️ and editing videos.

I started editing in 2021, and I’m still active on Instagram as @akariless
.

Thanks for stopping by and reading a bit about me! 🌸
